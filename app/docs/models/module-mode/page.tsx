      <h2>Launch a coin</h2>
      <ol className={styles.steps}>
        <li>Open <Link href="/launch/modules">Module Mode</Link> and connect your wallet.</li>
        <li>Enter the coin details, optional image and social links, creator fees and initial buy. Website launches require a first buy worth at least about $2 in ETH, plus gas, on Ethereum and Robinhood. The buy is included in the launch transaction.</li>
        <li>Open <strong>Modules</strong> to find optional modules and complete their configuration.</li>
        <li>Check the total fees and funding, select <strong>Launch coin</strong>, then confirm in your wallet.</li>
      </ol>
      <p className={styles.bodyCopy}>The active release determines the network, engine and supported configuration.
        Gas, the initial buy and any module funding are separate amounts in the launch review.</p>
      <p className={styles.bodyCopy}>An image is optional. Launching without one records the Programmable logo as the token image.
        Add a website, X or Telegram link directly; <strong>Add more links</strong> opens Discord, GitHub and GitBook.
        These links appear on the Explore card and coin page.</p>

    <section id="configuration">
      <h2>Configuration and compatibility</h2>
      <p className={styles.bodyCopy}>A module declares its fields, types, units, allowed values and required
        capabilities. The website uses those declarations to build the form and check compatibility.
        Conflicting configurations or combinations outside the host&apos;s limits are rejected before launch.</p>
      <p className={styles.bodyCopy}>Modules can have state, operating budgets and management actions. A new
        capability or market engine requires a reviewed extension before it becomes available. The catalog
        comes from the service and grows independently of this guide.</p>
      <p className={styles.bodyCopy}>The native ETH engine charges an additional 0.20% protocol fee. With eligible
        module families, half is shared equally among those families. Without eligible families, the protocol
        receives the full fee. Creator fees and module operating budgets are accounted for separately.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="management">
      <h2>Manage a launched coin</h2>
      <p className={styles.bodyCopy}>After indexing, the coin appears in Explore and the launching wallet&apos;s
        profile. Its controls show supported reads and actions. Transaction actions require the wallet role
        specified by the deployed contracts.</p>
      <p className={styles.bodyCopy}>Each launch records its module revisions and configuration. Publishing
        another revision does not replace existing coins. Later state changes follow the deployed permissions.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="developers">
      <h2>Index Module Mode</h2>
      <p className={styles.bodyCopy}>Indexers recognize the launch source independently of module names.
        Read <Link href="/developer-reference/module-mode-indexing">Index Module Mode launches</Link> for the
        ABI, canonical identity and finality procedure.</p>

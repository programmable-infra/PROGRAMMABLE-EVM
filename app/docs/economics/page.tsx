      <section id="basis">
        <h2>Fee units</h2>
        <p>One basis point is 0.01%; 30 bps is 0.30%. Gas, initial purchases, liquidity deposits and module operating budgets are separate costs. The launch review shows the selected fees and funding before wallet confirmation.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="custom">
        <h2>Robinhood Custom Launches</h2>
        <p>Current Custom Launch Plans use a <strong>0.30% (30 bps)</strong> platform fee on buys and sells prepared by Programmable. It is deducted from the gross output in the output asset, rounded down once. A gross output of 100 tokens pays 0.3 tokens to Programmable before the remaining output reaches the trader. Creator and pool fees are separate.</p>
        <p>The trade review shows the exact fee, asset and recipient before wallet confirmation. The routed fee is paid to <code>0xD88539d3c4C460136a733A3Fd60cf6BF269079da</code> in the same swap. This pricing applies to Programmable routes; it does not establish a fee on external trades.</p>
        <p>Earlier signed fee obligations and Native20 pools retain their recorded 0.20% model. When the existing pool fee is verified, Programmable adds no second route fee. Native20 accrues native ETH claims to its fixed recipient; claiming those balances does not create new revenue.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="ethereum">
        <h2>Ethereum Mainnet Custom Hooks</h2>
        <p>The current Programmable platform fee is <strong>0.30% (30 bps)</strong> on each successful buy or sell through the launch&apos;s fee-bearing pool. Project fees and LP fees are separate. A 1 ETH trade at this rate allocates 0.003 ETH to Programmable.</p>
        <p>Verify the deployed hook&apos;s fee basis, asset, accounting mode and claim path. A launch stamp establishes origin; it does not prove fee enforcement or payment. Earlier Classic contracts and retained fee-certified API profiles keep their recorded 0.10% share.</p>
        <p><Link href="/developer-reference/ethereum-custom-hook#fees">Read the Ethereum Custom Hook reference</Link> for launch inputs and fee disclosure.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="modules">
        <h2>Module Mode</h2>
        <p>The current coin builder uses Foundation. Programmable receives 0.30% on each buy and sell through the launch pool. Creators can add a fee from 0% to 10% in whole percentage points. Selected modules may receive part of that creator fee; they do not reduce the platform&apos;s 0.30%.</p>
        <p>Both fees are calculated on the gross quote amount and accrue in the quote asset. A 1 WETH trade with a 1% creator fee allocates 0.003 WETH to Programmable and 0.01 WETH to creator and module recipients. The combined fee is 1.30%. Foundation&apos;s initial pool has no additional LP fee. Earlier engines retain their original settings; read the <a href="https://programmable.market/api/module-mode">active engine</a> and launch review for the applicable rate.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="revenue">
        <h2>Protocol revenue allocation</h2>
        <p>The revenue policy assigns 50% of net protocol revenue to V4 buybacks and burns and 50% to the treasury, with daily processing. Net revenue excludes creator, module author and other third-party liabilities. For Native20, the buyback allocation is equivalent to 10 bps of the qualifying trading amount; for a 30 bps platform share it is equivalent to 15 bps.</p>
        <p>Collected V4 from the project&apos;s main-token LP fees is also assigned to daily burns. Finalized transactions establish what was processed. A policy, an accrued balance and a completed burn must not be counted as the same event. Read <Link href="/docs/v4-token">V4 token</Link> for token identity and burn accounting.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="analytics">
        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://dune.com/programmablehq/analytics">Dune dashboard</a> refreshes every 24 hours and separates launch counts, creator rewards, protocol revenue and burns. Custom fees are counted when <code>NativeFeesAccrued</code> credits the recipient, including unclaimed balances. Claiming later does not create new revenue. Gas, liquidity deposits and LP fees are excluded from those Custom totals.</p>

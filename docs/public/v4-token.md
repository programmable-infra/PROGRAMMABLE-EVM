## Liquidity and trading fees

The V4/ETH pool on **Robinhood Chain** charges a **1% trading fee**, shared by liquidity providers according to their positions. Wallet-to-wallet transfers do not incur this pool fee.

Programmable's liquidity is held in a [locked position](https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com/address/0x9f9424BbCCe8a865f70155fe40Fb22A103eBEc63), NFT `1708785`. The position can collect fees while its liquidity remains locked. It earns ETH on buys and V4 on sells.

## Buybacks and burns

Programmable allocates **50% of the fees received from its own liquidity position to automated V4 buybacks and burns**. The other **50% goes to the treasury** for ongoing costs, future development and other platform needs.

Module Mode and Custom Launch platform fees follow the same allocation. [Fees and revenue](economics.md#platform-revenue) explains their rates and the planned Custom Launch update. Creator fees and module rewards are excluded.

Burns send V4 to `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`. These tokens are excluded from circulation, while the contract's reported total supply remains one billion. [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/programmablehq/analytics) tracks fees and completed burns and links to the burn transactions.

V4 does not give holders company ownership or a right to platform revenue. Buybacks and burns do not guarantee a price or return. This token is separate from Programmable's earlier Ethereum tokens.

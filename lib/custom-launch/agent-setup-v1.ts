    "Historical 3.4/3.5 profiles bind declarative behaviorScenarioInputs and behaviorScenarioInputsHash into launchIntentHash. Inputs may name only exact prepared targets, poolManager or the fixed v4-actions-v1 harness and may not contain scripts, URLs, assertions, expected results, statuses or runner parameters. Older bytes retain their immutable read and byte-identical retry semantics; fresh writes require the selected server version.",
    "If status is action_required, follow the resource remediation, fix the exact source or config finding, rebuild and submit a new immutable request. Do not ask for a manual allowlist or retry unchanged bytes.",
    "Follow a walletHandoffUrl only after the server-authored resource is authorized; client, CLI or model output cannot create that state. Missing behavior execution leaves behavior, fee, liquidity and routability claims unverified; an authenticated executed failure blocks the handoff. Historically, pre-3.6 open arbitrary-custom-hook lanes carry no automatic Programmable-fee claim, and a historical 10 bps claim requires a fee-certified profile or adapter and its exact stamped PoolKey. Profile 3.6 separately requires first-party Programmable trade collection at 30 bps with per-trade evidence; arbitrary hook admission alone never proves that collection.",
    "If profile 3.4.0 is later activated, wallet handoff additionally requires exact source, compiler and graph binding, static admission, a platform admission receipt, exact Router simulation, verified behavior evidence and verified exact 10 bps fee-path evidence. Missing, not-configured or unavailable execution cannot authorize; executed behavior failure or a mutable fee path blocks terminally. This describes a pending server gate, not current activation or evidence. The server owns every assertion and verdict, and legacy resources retain their stored evidence state.",
    "When the selected lane uses applicant buy or sell rates, each rate is capped at 100000 hundredths of a bip, equal to 1000 bps or 10 percent. The server enforces that cap in additive-platform-share and inclusive-selected-total modes. Read the platform rate from the selected policy: profile 3.6 uses 3000 hundredths of a bip, equal to 30 bps or 0.3 percent. Programmable trades require their own collection evidence; launch admission does not prove fee collection. A native30 waiver requires server-verified runtime plus per-trade accrual proof, never an applicant assertion or getter alone, and prevents an additional routed fee only for that proven trade.",
    "If status is awaiting_funding_authorization, open only the same-origin walletHandoffUrl and stop for the connected controller to review and sign the exact funding typed data in the website. At authorized, stop again for the controller to review and send the exact Router transaction. Respect expiresAt and secondsRemaining; never reuse an expired handoff. Then use status to follow that single resource to a terminal state.",
